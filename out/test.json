These workflows provide a structured approach to building, managing, and deploying complex AI solutions at scale within the Azure ecosystem. By integrating various AI models, data sources, and processing steps, Azure AI Foundry workflows streamline the operationalization of AI and facilitate collaboration between data scientists and developers.\n\n### Key features\n- **Modular design**: Workflows are composed of modular components, including data connectors, AI model nodes, and processing nodes. Each component represents a distinct AI task and can be configured with specific parameters.\n- **Visual and code-based authoring**: Users can create workflows using a visual designer by dragging and dropping components, or programmatically via APIs.\n- **Integration**: Workflows support integration with Azure AI services and custom AI models, providing flexibility and extensibility.\n- **Automation**: Workflows can be triggered by schedules or events, enabling automated execution of AI processes.\n- **Scalability**: Designed for cloud-native workloads, workflows can be deployed to scalable Azure compute targets such as Azure Kubernetes Service or serverless environments.\n\n## How to use Azure AI Foundry workflows\n\n### Prerequisites\n- An Azure subscription with appropriate permissions.\n- Registered AI models in Azure AI Foundry.\n- Access to required data sources.\n\n### Creating a workflow\n1. **Define workflow components**: Select data sources, AI models, and processing steps relevant to your AI solution.\n2. **Design the workflow**:\n    - Use the visual designer to drag and drop components and connect them to form a pipeline.\n    - Alternatively, use Azure AI Foundry APIs to define the workflow programmatically.\n3. **Configure components**: Set parameters for each component, ensuring compatibility between input and output formats.\n4. **Set triggers**: Configure the workflow to run on a schedule or in response to specific events.\n5. **Validate and test**: Run the workflow in a test environment to ensure it operates as expected.\n\n### Deploying and managing workflows\n- **Deployment**: Publish the validated workflow to Azure infrastructure. Choose appropriate compute targets based on workload requirements.\n- **Monitoring**: Use built-in tools to monitor workflow execution, track performance metrics, and diagnose errors. Configure alerts for failures or performance issues.\n- **Versioning and scaling**: Manage workflow versions for updates or rollback. Scale resources to handle varying workloads efficiently.\n\n## Use cases\nAzure AI Foundry workflows are ideal for scenarios requiring:\n- Automated data ingestion and preprocessing\n- Model training and inference orchestration\n- Post-processing and result export\n- Integration of multiple AI models and data sources in a single pipeline\n- Operationalizing AI solutions in production environments\n\n## Summary\nAzure AI Foundry workflows simplify the development, orchestration, and deployment of AI solutions. By providing a modular, scalable, and automated approach, they enable organizations to efficiently manage the AI lifecycle and deliver reliable AI-powered applications."}
